# sensor_msgs/LaserScan Message
# File: sensor_msgs/LaserScan.msg
# Raw Message Definition
# # Single scan from a planar laser range-finder
# #
# # If you have another ranging device with different behavior (e.g. a sonar
# # array), please find or create a different message, since applications
# # will make fairly laser-specific assumptions about this data

# Header header            # timestamp in the header is the acquisition time of 
#                          # the first ray in the scan.
#                          #
#                          # in frame frame_id, angles are measured around

#                          # with zero angle being forward along the x axis

# float32 angle_max        # end angle of the scan [rad]

# float32 time_increment   # time between measurements [seconds] - if your scanner
#                          # is moving, this will be used in interpolating position
